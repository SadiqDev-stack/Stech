        <h3>My Tech Journey üë®‚Äçüíªüõ∞Ô∏è</h3><br>
        <img src="./showcase/pic1.png" alt="sadiq stech, sadiq abubakar picture">
        <br><br>
        <span>
          i started ny tech journey when i was like 14, 
          i started exploring the hardware and how to build physical things by using free Resources like youtube google i search and learn how to build things, 
          what make me break into tech is my love for sciefy movies 
          and i also like seeing how things are builded from scratch
          from imagination to research and to reality, 
          <br><br>
          i have created alot of hardware project and prototypes like e-cars, escabators, water pump, water level indicator etc
          which really inspired me and motivate me to continue striving, but unfortunately due to resources constraint 
          some resources i can afford and buy while others are not even available in our local market , so i decided to start coding <br>
          <br>
          my coding journey started in 2024 when i graduated from secondary school, at that time my father is already sponsoring my two elders and he is retired so i should wait for next year, 
          at that time i decided to learn to code, i started making research on how to code, i consistenly learn and make post on social media, 
          luckily i get a mentor which guide me through the process, his name is abdulrahman sani he is a full stack web developer which live in sokoto state , 
          he bless me with a lot of resources like pdfs, tutorials etc with consistensy i learn and practice myself i ask about what i dont understand, and even if i build something small it is a source of happiness for me 
          , like this i kept posting and building projects to enhance my skills, in 2024 i have learned about frontend web development
          and i have builded alot of project like weather app, quiz app, space game, robot dog etc 
          they really inspired me and i feel so good creating interfaces for an api, 
          so by 2025 January i decided why not learn how to create my api , than depending on others, 
          thats when i started learning backend development <br><br>
          in backend development i was recommended to learn nodejs expressjs and mongodb, because they are modern 
          i started making research and learned alot, it take me almost 4month to get the basics,
          after learning backend development i planned why not build something that will inspire peoples to motivate and support me 
          so two ideas popup s'post and eid wisher, <br>
          at that time is around eid, i started building eid-wisher, which is app others 
          can use to wish there friends , i was surprised about 1000+ peoples use it when i launch it, 
          i also created s'post app for posting where peoples post without signup, others can react etc
          surprisingly many peoples use it and that keep me motivated and it was my upto date project 
          <br><br>
          i have a lot of project but i dont get opportunity to document them because at that time 
          i cant even capture no good Resource
          , and all my hardware project are small prototypes, to show  i can build big versions in future

      <h2>Challanges I Have Faced</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes I felt like giving up because I live in a place where most people are not very educated. I live near Moduganari, and people there don‚Äôt see value in the things I‚Äôm doing. Some even think I‚Äôm crazy, some think I‚Äôm wasting my time. Even I sometimes doubted myself, thinking: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been doing this for years with no result. No jobs here. It‚Äôs draining your time.‚Äù* Imagine coding on a split-screen phone with bugs everywhere.¬† <br><br>
‚Äé
‚ÄéBut when those dark moments came, I held onto my belief, faith, and motivation.¬†
‚Äé<br><br>
‚ÄéHere are things that motivated me to keep going:¬† <br><br>
‚Äé- When I build something people think only ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù people can do, I feel proud and unstoppable.¬† <br><br>
‚Äé- When mentors motivate me (like one abroad who once told me, *‚ÄúEven if I had only a keypad phone, I would never stop coding, because I know its real value.‚Äù* He even runs a startup that runs for so maany years) .¬† <br> <br>
‚Äé- When I see people in the same journey succeed, it motivates me.¬† <br> <br>
‚Äé- When I see valuable  tech hubs, opportunities and tech events i feel even happier.¬† <br> <br>
‚Äé- When my friends spend time motivating me, I gain extra energy.¬† <br> <br>
‚Äé- My social media feed is full of motivational content that i watch when am tired.¬† <br><br>

      <h2>My Vision</h2>
      <p>
        ‚Äé- Make Africa, especially Nigeria, a more developed place.¬† <br><br>
‚Äé- Promote technology.¬†<br><br>
‚Äé- Provide tech hubs and startups that create our own resources instead of depending on others.¬† <br><br>
‚Äé- Inspire And Support young people from  same background to break barriers through persistence and creativity.¬† <br><br>

‚ÄéApart from coding and hardware, I also  have  soft  skills like graphics design  that help in alot in building things  and sometimes finicially.¬†<br><br>
i also learned alot like cybersecurity how to protect my software and my self from attacks, seo etc

      <h2>Future Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Currently I have imagined and kept my startup ideas , because some are unique I won't say them all <br><br>
‚Äé<img src="./showcase/agri.png" alt="">
‚ÄéMy first startup is agriVoice which is voice of the farmers , this is an ai powered software that solve the main heart pain of farmers and also amplify there voice , that's why I called it agriVoice , the problems that this can solve
‚Äé<br><br>
- Providing virtual market, a very easy market place that peoples can easily sale what they want in the price they need, get direct access to client, instead of depending on traditional or local marketplace that won't favour them
<br><br>
-  most farmers don't have access to secured land eg most land are occupied by terrorist, and the land tenure system is very complex , so this app will provide access to cheap land dealers and also allow government ngos etc that want to support farming to host event that will give farmers opportunities and also englight them
<br><br>
- we also have ai farm bot that educate farmers and enlight them , solve there problems, and alert them depending on location and conditions eg "this season is good for planting rice in bama"
<br><br>
- the app also connect farmers with others in diffirent area to share local practices / ideas etc... 
<br><br>
there are alot startups ideas i have which i will work on them over time and bring them to reality, and they are very unique because they will also provide profit(marketable) not just product
